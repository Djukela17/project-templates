# Project Templates for working with docker

## Getting the desired template

Each available template is on a separate branch of this repository.

To clone a desired template repo, do something like:
```git clone -b <template-project-branch> --single-branch https://github.com/Djukela17/project-templates.git [your-project-name]```
- *`<template-project-branch>`* is the branch containing the desired template
- *`[your-project-name]`* is the folder name where the template will be cloned. It is optional.
