# Project Template for react and next

## Instructions
* Clone the repo using the following command:
```sh
git clone -b node-react --single-branch https://github.com/Djukela17/project-templates.git my-project
```
* initialize your node repo in the `/app` directory (creatine if it is not present)
* add your project dependencies to the `package.json` file
* the container by default runs the `dev` script (it starts with `npm run dev`),
 so you need to add it to the `package.json` file
